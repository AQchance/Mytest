In clinical practice, management of iliotibial band (ITB) pain often includes passive treatments that aim to reduce “tension” in the ITB. Various methods are used to estimate the mechanical properties of the ITB. Comparison of such methods in pain-free and injured populations may provide a better understanding of the mechanical and morphological properties of the ITB, and its implication in musculoskeletal injuries. This study aimed to systematically review the mechanical properties and morphology of ITB using a range of experimental methods and evaluate differences between individuals with and without lower limb musculoskeletal conditions.It was the best of times it was the worst of times it was the age of wisdom it was the age of foolishness it was the epoch of belief it was the epoch of incredulity it was the season of light it was the season of darkness it was the spring of hope it was the winter of despair.
